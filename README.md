## 🚀 Engineering Portfolio: The 2025 Modernization Roadmap

Leveraging insights from **AWS re:Invent 2025** (specifically the *App Modernization* and *Agentic AI* tracks), I am building a reference implementation for highly regulated industries.

My goal is to demonstrate the full lifecycle: from optimizing Java Compute to orchestrating Autonomous Agents via **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**.

---

### ✅ Phase 1: Production-Ready Serverless Java (Completed)
**The Workshop Insight:** *"From Serverful to Serverless Java"* & *"Level Up with Powertools"*
**The Implementation:** A robust API connecting Java 21 with GenAI, hardened for production.
* **Core:** Java 21 + Spring Boot 3 + SnapStart (CRaC).
* **Observability:** Integrated **AWS Lambda Powertools for Java** for structured logging, tracing (X-Ray), and Idempotency handling (crucial for payments).
* **Repo:** [🔗 Serverless Java 21 SnapStart + Bedrock API](https://github.com/jmontagne/poc_java_lambda_snapstart_bedrock)

### 🚧 Phase 2: Data & The "Model Context Protocol" (Next Up)
**The Workshop Insight:** *"Building Production-Ready Data Systems for AI"*
**The Goal:** Exposing Legacy SQL data to AI Agents without building ad-hoc connectors.
* **Innovation:** Implementing **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** to standardize how Agents query the database.
* **Tech Stack:**
    * **AWS RDS Proxy** + **Aurora Limitless** (Scalable SQL).
    * **MCP Server (Java/Spring)**: Creating a standardized interface for AI.
    * **Hibernate/JPA**: Optimized for short-lived Lambda contexts.

---

### 🛠️ Phase 3: Automated Refactoring Pipeline (Planned)
**The Workshop Insight:** *"Automate Java application upgrade with GenAI"*
**The Goal:** Accelerating Technical Debt reduction (Java 8 -> 21).
* **The Solution:** Building a CI/CD pipeline step that utilizes **Amazon Q Code Transformation**.
* **Focus:** Automated dependency analysis and upgrade planning for monolithic repos.

---

### 🧪 Phase 4: The Performance Benchmark (Rust vs. Java)
**The Goal:** "Extreme Low Latency - Is it worth the rewrite?"
**The Solution:** A side-by-side comparison of the same logic written in **Java (SnapStart)** and **Rust**.
* **Tech Stack:** **Cargo Lambda**, **Rust Runtime for AWS Lambda**.
* **KPIs:** Cold Start duration, Memory footprint cost, Developer Velocity trade-offs.

---

### 🤖 Phase 5: Agentic Workflows & Spec-Driven Dev
**The Workshop Insight:** *"Create your own AI sidekick"* (Kiro IDE)
**The Goal:** Moving from "Chat" to "Action".
* **Methodology:** **Spec-Driven Development** using **Kiro** to generate compliant code.
* **Tech Stack:**
    * **Amazon Bedrock Agents** with **Strands** framework.
    * **Action Groups** defined via OpenAPI.
    * **SageMaker Unified Studio** for end-to-end ML lifecycle.
