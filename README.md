## 🚀 Engineering Portfolio & Modernization Roadmap

I don't just design systems; I build Proof of Concepts (POCs) to validate architecture decisions for high-stakes enterprise environments (Banking/Insurance).

Below is my active roadmap for demonstrating a full migration path from Legacy Java to AWS Serverless.

### 🏗️ Phase 1: Compute & AI Optimization (Completed)
**Goal:** Solve the "Cold Start" problem in Java to make Lambda viable for latency-sensitive APIs.
* **Project:** [Serverless Java 21 SnapStart + Bedrock API](https://github.com/jmontagne/poc_java_lambda_snapstart_bedrock)
* **Tech Stack:** Java 21, Spring Boot 3, AWS Lambda SnapStart, CRaC, AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5), Terraform.
* **Result:** Reduced cold starts by **90%** (<500ms) while integrating GenAI capabilities.

### 💾 Phase 2: Data Persistence & Consistency (Coming Soon)
**Goal:** Handle high-concurrency database connections in Serverless without exhausting the pool.
* **Focus:** Managing "Stale Connections" during SnapStart restore phases.
* **Tech Stack:** AWS RDS Proxy, PostgreSQL, Hibernate/JPA, HikariCP customization.

### ⚡ Phase 3: Event-Driven Decoupling (Planned)
**Goal:** Breaking the Monolith into independent, asynchronous microservices.
* **Focus:** Reliable event processing and failure handling.
* **Tech Stack:** Amazon EventBridge, SQS (DLQ), Lambda Consumers.

### 🛡️ Phase 4: Enterprise Security (Planned)
**Goal:** Zero-Trust implementation for public-facing APIs.
* **Focus:** Authentication and Web Application Firewall rules.
* **Tech Stack:** API Gateway, Amazon Cognito (OAuth2/OIDC), AWS WAF.
